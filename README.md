# Simulink-Viewer     
### Description / TODO:
### Key features of the software tool will include:
* Loading and parsing Simulink MDL files
* Displaying the Simulink model in a hierarchical structure  
### What do we use?  
* We used javaFx  
### How do we do it?  
1- We made class for blocks, lines, and branches, all with the appropriate data fields and methods to store the parsed information from the file  
2- Parsing code using File and Scanner classes  
3- We used JavaFx library to implement the GUI of our program using the following classes: 
* rectangle class to design blocks with proper location and dimensions.  
 * arrow class and line class to connect these rectangles with each other  
* image and image view classes to display images on the blocks  
 * text and label classes to display the name of each block   
 then all of the previous classes were put in one pane to display it on the stage and application was launched in main method.
